The [Blizzard World of Warcraft APIs](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/world-of-warcraft) expose a lot of information, which means the Argent Pony Warcraft Client has many classes to work with.
Instead of documenting everything in a big README file, we're adding documentation powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
