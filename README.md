# Argent Squire Warcraft Client Documentation

This is the **documentation** branch of the Argent Squire Warcraft client.
It includes documentation based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
Updates to this branch are deployed to the **gh-pages** branch via the [documentation](https://github.com/blizzard-net/warcraft/actions/workflows/documentation.yml) GitHub Actions workflow.
See the [Deploying to GitHub Pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages) section of the Docusaurus documentation for additional details on how this works.

To run the website locally, install Node.js and Yarn as described in the [Requirements](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#requirements) section of the Docusarus docs, then run the website from the **warcraft** subfolder:

```bash
cd warcraft
npm run start
```
