```shell
Install-Package ArgentPonyWarcraftClient
```

## Optional Dependency Injection Support

If you'd like to use dependency injection, install the [ArgentPonyWarcraftClient.Extensions.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ArgentPonyWarcraftClient.Extensions.DependencyInjection) package from the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or by running the following command from the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package ArgentPonyWarcraftClient.Extensions.DependencyInjection
